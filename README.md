1. **UnitConverter** :
   How It Works:
   1.Input Value: Enter the value you wish to convert.
   2.Choose Units: Pick the units you are converting from and to.
   3.View Results: Instantly see the converted value and adjust as needed.

   Specs :
   minSdk = 24
   targetSdk = 34
   compileSdk = 34
   jvmTarget = "1.8"
   kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = "1.5.1"

2. **Shopping List**
   How It Works:
   1.Add shopping item and quantity.
   2.Can Edit or remove the inserted item
   3.This is state based application and doesn't provide db support yet. (will be worked on in future.)

   Specs :
   minSdk = 24
   targetSdk = 34
   compileSdk = 34
   jvmTarget = "1.8"
   kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = "1.5.1"

3.**Counter app**
  It is a practice app for demostrating MVVM. 
  How it works : 
  1. Use Increment button to increment count by 1.
  2. Use Decrement button to decrement count by 1.
  3. State is maintained when mobile screen is roatated.

   Specs :
   minSdk = 24
   targetSdk = 34
   compileSdk = 34
   jvmTarget = "1.8"
   kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = "1.5.1"
   
4. **Recipe app**
   It is a practice project for demonstrating how to fetch data using retrofit apis and display on UI.
   Uses TheMealDB's api

   Specs :
   minSdk = 24
   targetSdk = 34
   compileSdk = 34
   jvmTarget = "1.8"
   kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = "1.5.1"
