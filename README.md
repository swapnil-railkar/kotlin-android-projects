   3.View Results: Instantly see the converted value and adjust as needed.

   Specs :
   minSdk = 24
   targetSdk = 34
   compileSdk = 34
   jvmTarget = "1.8"
   kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = "1.5.1"

2. **Shopping List**
   How It Works:
   1.Add shopping item and quantity.
   2.Can Edit or remove the inserted item
   3.This is state based application and doesn't provide db support yet. (will be worked on in future.)

   Specs :
   minSdk = 24
   targetSdk = 34
   compileSdk = 34
   jvmTarget = "1.8"
   kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = "1.5.1"
