1. Main Projects :
   a. TodoIfy :
   A **task management app** designed to help users stay on top of their daily to-dos, prioritize effectively, and maintain a productive workflow. Whether you're juggling personal, work, or recurring tasks, this app simplifies task organization and makes sure nothing slips through the cracks.

### Key Features:
- **Daily Task Overview:** See all tasks for the day, including any incomplete tasks from the previous day, in one place.
- **Task Prioritization:** Mark tasks as "important" to bring them to the top of your list. Tasks are automatically sorted by importance, date, and title for maximum organization.
- **Automatic Task Expiry:** Tasks are removed from the app after 30 days of creation or once past the due date. Non-expiring tasks (like everyday tasks) stay until manually deleted.
- **History Section:** View all tasks from the past 30 days, including those that were marked as incomplete or deleted.
- **Customizable Notifications:** Get notified about pending tasks every 3 hours by default, or customize your notification schedule to suit your needs.
- **Clear All Tasks:** Easily clear all tasks with just a tap when you want to start fresh.
  
### Additional Features in Development:
- **Recurring Tasks**: Set up tasks that repeat daily, weekly, or monthly.
- **Task Collaboration**: Share tasks with others for seamless teamwork.
- **Pomodoro Timer**: Stay focused with a built-in Pomodoro timer for efficient work sessions.
- **Custom Tags & Priority Levels**: Organize tasks by priority and custom tags for even more flexibility.
  
I built this app with a focus on **simplicity, productivity**, and **intuitive design**. It's designed to help users not only stay organized but also manage their time more effectively with powerful notifications, smart sorting, and the ability to track task history.

The app is perfect for anyone looking for a **streamlined** way to handle daily tasks, whether for **work, personal projects**, or just staying organized.

 b. SafeNotes : 
 This app allows users to store their notes securely, offering the option to assign unique passwords to each note or use a predefined default password for convenience. Notes with unique passwords cannot be accessed via the default password, ensuring maximum security and privacy.

Key features include:

Password Protection: Safeguard individual notes with custom or default passwords.
Room Database: Efficiently stores and manages user data.
Password Reset and Recovery: Easily regain access if a password is forgotten.
Planned Enhancements: Future updates will enable users to store images and add drawing capabilities to their notes.
Designed using MVVM architecture for a clean separation of concerns, and powered by Android Navigation for seamless user experience, this project highlights my skills in modern Android development practices using Android Studio.
